# SpotifyUnWrapped

SpotifyUnWrapped is a Python script that provides an accurate and on-demand recap of your Spotify listening history, including your top tracks and artists. By allowing you to access your true listening habits year-round, this project challenges the accuracy of Spotify Wrapped and shows that your music story is more dynamic than a single annual snapshot.

## Why SpotifyUnWrapped?

Spotify Wrapped is a fun and popular feature, but it doesnâ€™t always reflect your true listening habits. Its algorithms can skew data due to:
- Limited time frames.
- Exclusion of certain types of streams.
- Emphasis on engagement rather than accuracy.

**SpotifyUnWrapped** aims to:
1. Give you full control over your music data with on-demand insights.
2. Provide a transparent and accurate reflection of your top tracks and artists.
3. Showcase that your listening history is more than what Spotify Wrapped portrays.

## Features

- Fetch your top tracks and artists over different time ranges (short, medium, or long term).
- Generate Markdown tables for sharing your personalized music stats.
- Create Mermaid diagrams to visualize your listening habits.
- Empower users with accurate data to challenge Spotify Wrapped's limitations.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.
2. A Spotify account with listening data.
3. A Spotify Developer account to create and manage your app.

   - Provide a name (e.g., `SpotifyUnWrapped`) and description for your app.
   - Agree to the terms and click **"Create"**.

3. **Set the Redirect URI**
